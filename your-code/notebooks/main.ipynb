Here is the ([documentation on how to achieve it](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.agg.html)). Take a moment or two to read the documentation and google examples because it is pretty complex.\n",

Using the object param will allow you to create the aggregated columns with the desirable names without renaming them. However, you will probably encounter a warning indicating supplying an object to `agg()` will become outdated. It's up to you which way you will use. Try both ways out. Any way is fine as long as it works."
